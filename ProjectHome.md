This project is intended to provide a simple list management system without using relational database. With listman, users can set up a small and simple database without going through all the trouble of setting up a relational database. This program is written in Java and the graphical user interface uses Java Swing. This program is also cross-platform and uses simple flat-file database.

Currently, this program only manages books with preset columns, but in the next version, the system would be more flexible and should be able to manage any kind of list. Right now, listman features most basic functions dealing with a table, such as adding, removing, copying, and pasting. It also allows export to csv and printing to a printer. It also does column sorting, but this function needs to be improved. There are still a lot more work to be done with this project, such as adding a date selector.
